## 📚 Project Description

As part of the university coursework, I implemented and compared **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** — both linear and kernel-based — from scratch. Models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation and tuned with grid search for optimal performance.
